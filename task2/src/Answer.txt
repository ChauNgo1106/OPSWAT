+ Explain what transform method is doing
=> Answer: The function itselft is computing the power of two for each digit of a given number and
add them all into the result. Finally return the result at the end.
ex: 122 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 5
9 =  9^2 = 81
+ Identify any potential issue or inefficiencies
=> Answer: what if the number in the array is huge, let's say then you might add up "while" looping  until
the number becomes zero (ex: 10000 might need 5 times "while" loop until you can reach 0) and it will slow 
down the system in term of performace. Instead of finding each digit by divided by 10, how about converting 
each integer string literal into the string, the power of 2 and add them all to the total of all digits.
